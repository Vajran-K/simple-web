        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse environment, including oceans, landmasses, and an atmosphere that allows for a wide range of ecosystems. Here’s an overview:<br>
<br>
        Key Facts About Earth:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance from the Sun: Approximately 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diameter: About 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), making it the fifth-largest planet in the solar system.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Length: A day on Earth lasts 24 hours, the time it takes for Earth to complete one full rotation on its axis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year Length: Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days, resulting in a leap year every four years to adjust the calendar.<br>
        <br>
        Surface and Atmosphere:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface Features: Earth's surface is about 71% water, with the remaining 29% covered by continents and islands. It has diverse landscapes, including mountains, forests, deserts, and oceans.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature: Earth has a moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from -89°C (-128°F) in Antarctica to 58°C (136°F) in the hottest deserts.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere: The atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, which supports life and protects the planet from harmful solar radiation.<br>
        <br>
        Composition and Structure:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core: Earth has a dense iron-nickel core, which is responsible for generating its magnetic field.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantle: The mantle is composed of silicate rocks and is responsible for tectonic movements and volcanic activity.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crust: Earth's crust is the outermost layer, divided into tectonic plates that float on the mantle, causing earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain-building.<br>
        <br>
        Unique Characteristics:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water: Earth is the only known planet with liquid water on its surface, a key factor supporting life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life: Earth's unique conditions, such as its atmosphere and liquid water, support an immense diversity of life forms, from microorganisms to large mammals.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tectonics: Earth's surface is constantly reshaped by plate tectonics, which leads to mountain formation, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.<br>
        <br>
        Exploration:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Exploration: Humans have explored Earth through various means, from ancient seafaring to modern space missions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space Missions: Satellites like Hubble and Earth-observing missions provide detailed data about Earth's climate, atmosphere, and ecosystems.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's balanced climate, water, and atmosphere make it the only known planet to sustain life, and its diverse ecosystems continue to be studied for insights into the broader universe.<br>
