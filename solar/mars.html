        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is one of the most studied planets in our solar system and a key focus for future human exploration.<br>
        <br>
Key Facts About Mars:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance from the Sun: Approximately 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diameter: About 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles), roughly half the size of Earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Length: A day on Mars (called a sol) lasts about 24 hours and 37 minutes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year Length: Mars takes about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.<br>
<br>
Surface and Atmosphere:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface Features: Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system (Olympus Mons) and the longest canyon (Valles Marineris). Its surface is rocky, dusty, and marked by ancient river valleys and polar ice caps.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature: Mars is much colder than Earth, with average temperatures around -63°C (-81°F).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere: Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95%), with small amounts of nitrogen and argon. It cannot support human life without assistance.<br>
<br>
Composition and Structure:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core: Mars is believed to have a solid iron-nickel core surrounded by a silicate mantle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crust: The crust is primarily basaltic rock, with significant amounts of iron-rich minerals giving Mars its red color.<br>
<br>
Water on Mars:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence suggests that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, including lakes, rivers, and possibly oceans.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, water exists in the form of ice at the polar caps and beneath the surface.<br>
<br>
Unique Characteristics:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust Storms: Mars experiences massive, planet-wide dust storms that can last for weeks or months.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moons: Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and may be captured asteroids.<br>
<br>
Exploration:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past Missions: NASA,s Mariner, Viking, and Spirit & Opportunity rovers provided early insights into Mars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current Missions: NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, and China’s Zhurong rover, are currently exploring Mars.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future Missions: NASA and ESA plan missions to return Martian soil samples to Earth, and there are long-term goals for human missions to Mars.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars remains a fascinating target for exploration due to its potential to have supported life in the past and its role in humanity's future as a possible second home.<br>
