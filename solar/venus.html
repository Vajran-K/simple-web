        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and mass. However, its surface and atmosphere are drastically different from Earth’s. Here’s an overview:<br>
<br>
        Key Facts About Venus:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance from the Sun: Approximately 108.2 million kilometers (67.2 million miles).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diameter: About 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), making it nearly the same size as Earth.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Length: A day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days, longer than its year (225 Earth days).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year Length: Venus completes one orbit around the Sun in 225 Earth days.<br>
        <br>
        Surface and Atmosphere:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface Features: Venus has a rocky surface with vast plains, mountains, and thousands of volcanoes, some possibly still active.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature: Venus has an extremely hot surface temperature, averaging around 467°C (872°F), hotter than Mercury, due to its thick atmosphere.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere: The atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with thick clouds of sulfuric acid, making it highly reflective. The pressure is about 90 times that of Earth’s.<br>
        <br>
        Composition and Structure:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core: Venus is believed to have a metallic core made of iron and nickel, similar to Earth’s, though it is not fully understood.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantle and Crust: The planet has a silicate mantle and crust, with surface features formed by tectonic activity, although no evidence of plate tectonics has been observed.<br>
        <br>
        Unique Characteristics:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotation: Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets (retrograde rotation), meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Moons or Rings: Venus has no natural satellites or rings.<br>
        <br>
        Exploration:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venera Program (1960s-1980s): The Soviet Union’s Venera spacecraft were the first to land on Venus, sending back images and data.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magellan (1990-1994): NASA’s Magellan mission mapped Venus' surface using radar to peer through the thick clouds.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upcoming Missions: The ESA’s EnVision mission and NASA’s VERITAS mission are planned for future exploration.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venus’ extreme temperatures, thick atmosphere, and volcanic features make it an intriguing planet for study, despite the challenges of exploring it.<br>
