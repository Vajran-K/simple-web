        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its unique sideways rotation and pale blue-green color caused by methane in its atmosphere. It is classified as an ice giant due to its composition.<br>
        <br>
Key Facts About Uranus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance from the Sun: Approximately 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diameter: About 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles), making it four times wider than Earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Length: A day on Uranus lasts about 17 hours and 14 minutes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year Length: Uranus takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.<br>
<br>
Surface and Atmosphere:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface: Uranus does not have a solid surface, as it is primarily made of ice, hydrogen, and helium.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature: Uranus is the coldest planet in the solar system, with temperatures plunging to around -224째C (-371째F).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere: Composed mainly of 83% hydrogen, 15% helium, and about 2% methane, which gives it its blue-green hue.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weather: Uranus experiences strong winds and seasonal storms that can last for decades due to its tilted axis.<br>
<br>
Rotation and Tilt:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of about 98째, which means it essentially rolls around the Sun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extreme tilt causes unique seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness.<br>
<br>
Rings of Uranus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus has a faint and narrow ring system, consisting of 13 known rings made of dark particles and ice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rings are much darker and less reflective than Saturn's rings.<br>
<br>
Moons of Uranus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus has 27 known moons, named after characters from Shakespearean plays and Alexander Pope's works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest moons include:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titania: The largest moon, with a mix of ice and rock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oberon: Known for its heavily cratered surface.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umbriel: The darkest of Uranus' large moons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariel: Known for its bright canyons and valleys.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda: Famous for its chaotic terrain and massive cliffs.<br>
<br>
Magnetic Field:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus has a highly tilted magnetic field, which is misaligned with its rotation axis by about 60째.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates a lopsided magnetosphere that behaves differently from other planets.<br>
<br>
Composition and Structure:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core: A small rocky core surrounded by icy materials.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mantle: Composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outer Layers: Made up of hydrogen and helium gas, with traces of methane.<br>
<br>
Exploration:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voyager 2 (1986): The only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, providing valuable data about its atmosphere, moons, and rings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future missions are being discussed to better understand Uranus and its moons.<br>
<br>
Unique Characteristics:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus is the only planet that rotates on its side, likely due to a massive collision early in its history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its icy composition sets it apart from gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus remains one of the least explored planets in the solar system, but its unique tilt, frigid atmosphere, and intriguing moons make it an exciting target for future exploration missions.<br>
