        The solar system is a vast system consisting of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and interplanetary dust. It formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust and is located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy.<br>  
        <br>
Key Components:<br>  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun: A massive star at the center, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. It generates energy through nuclear fusion and accounts for 99.86% of the solar system's mass.<br>  
<br>
  Planets:<br>  
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Inner Planets (Terrestrial):</strong> 
  <a href="mercury.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Mercury</a>, 
  <a href="venus.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Venus</a>, 
  <a href="earth.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Earth</a>, and 
  <a href="mars.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Mars</a> are rocky, small, and closer to the Sun.<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Outer Planets (Gas and Ice Giants):</strong> 
  <a href="jupiter.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Jupiter</a>, 
  <a href="saturn.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Saturn</a>, 
  <a href="uranus.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Uranus</a>, and 
  <a href="neptune.html" style="color: lightseagreen;">Neptune</a> are much larger, with thick atmospheres and many moons.<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf Planets: Objects like Pluto, Ceres, and Eris that orbit the Sun but haven't cleared their orbits of debris.<br>  
   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moons: Natural satellites orbiting planets, including Earth's Moon and notable ones like Ganymede (Jupiter) and Titan (Saturn).<br>  
<br>
Small Bodies:<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asteroids: Found mainly in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comets: Icy objects that develop tails when near the Sun.<br>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteoroids: Small rocky fragments, some of which burn up as meteors in Earth's atmosphere.<br>  
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuiper Belt & Oort Cloud: Distant regions containing icy bodies and the source of many comets.<br>  
<br>
The solar system is dynamic and interconnected, with gravity and cosmic forces shaping its components. Earth uniquely supports life due to its liquid water and protective atmosphere.<br>
